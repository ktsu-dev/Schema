I can see there's a build error in your SchemaEditor project. The error is on line 47 of `SchemaEditor.cs` where a `Start` method is being called with 6 arguments, but no overload exists that takes that many parameters.

Let me examine the problematic code to help fix this issue.

---

Read file: SchemaEditor/SchemaEditor.cs

---

I can see the issue! On line 47, there's a call to `ImGuiApp.Start` with 6 arguments, but it appears this method may not have an overload that accepts that many parameters. Let me check what methods are available in the ImGuiApp class to see what the correct signature should be.

Let me search for the specific ImGuiApp.Start method signatures to see what overloads are available:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "ImGuiApp\.Start\(" • **1** files</summary>

</details>

---

I can see that line 47 (which is actually line 46 in the search results) is calling `ImGuiApp.Start` with 6 parameters. Based on the error, this overload doesn't exist. Let me check what the correct signature should be by looking at recent changes or documentation for the ktsu.ImGuiApp package.

Based on the web search results, I can see that the ktsu.ImGuiApp library documentation shows an `AppConfig` class with different properties than what's being used in the code. Let me look for the exact `ImGuiApp.Start` method overloads that are currently available by checking if there have been recent changes to the library.

Based on the error and the web search results, it appears that the `ImGuiApp.Start` method signature has changed in recent versions of the ktsu.ImGuiApp library. Looking at the GitHub documentation, the newer API uses an `AppConfig` object rather than individual parameters.

Let me fix the call to use the correct signature based on the documentation I found:

---



---

I notice that I used `OnTick` for both `OnUpdate` and `OnRender`, but I should check if there's a specific render method. Let me examine the `OnTick` method to see if it's handling both update and rendering logic:

---

Read file: SchemaEditor/SchemaEditor.cs

---

Perfect! I can see that the `OnTick` method is handling the logic updating but it's not doing any rendering UI. The actual rendering is being done by the divider container which calls `ShowLeftPanel` and `ShowRightPanel`. Let me create a proper render method:

---



---

Now I need to update the Main method to use the correct render method:

---



---



---

Now let's test the build to see if we've resolved the issue:

---

```bash
dotnet build
```

```
C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Schema>dotnet build

```

---



---

It looks like the build is still running. Let me wait a moment and try again:

---

```bash
dotnet build --verbosity minimal
```

```
C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Schema>dotnet build --verbosity minimal

                                                                                                                 (0.1s)

---

I see there are still errors. It appears the `ImGuiAppConfig` doesn't contain `WindowState` and `OnWindowResized`. Let me check what properties are actually available:

---

Based on the documentation, I can see that the `AppConfig` class has different properties than what I used. Let me fix the configuration by removing the unsupported properties and using only what's available:

---



---



---

Now I need to handle the window state and window resizing functionality differently. Let me modify the `OnStart` method to set up the initial window state and handle the missing functionality:

---



---



---

Let me also handle the `OnTick` method to use expression body syntax to fix that warning:

---



---



---

I also need to remove the window resizing method call that's no longer being used. Let me clean up the save options functionality to not try to access the old WindowState:

---



---



---

I also need to remove the unused OnWindowResized method reference. Let me remove that method since it's no longer needed:

---



---



---

Now let's test the build again to see if we've resolved all the issues:

---

```bash
dotnet build --verbosity minimal
```

```
C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Schema>dotnet build --verbosity minimal

                                                                                                                 (0.1s)

```

---



---

We have two more issues to fix. The `OnStart` method is static but I'm trying to access it as an instance method, and there's a blank line issue. Let me fix these:

---



---



---

Now let me fix the blank line issue:

---



---



---

Let me read the current state of the file around line 96 to see exactly what needs to be fixed:

---

Read file: SchemaEditor/SchemaEditor.cs

---



---

I can see there are multiple blank lines between lines 96-98. Let me fix this:

---



---



---

Now let's test the build again to see if all errors have been resolved:

---

```bash
dotnet build --verbosity minimal
```

```
C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Schema>dotnet build --verbosity minimal

                                                                                                                 (0.1s)

```

---



---

We're down to one last issue - the `InitialWindowState` property is no longer being used. Let me remove it since we don't need it anymore:

---



---



---

I also need to remove the assignment to `InitialWindowState` in the constructor since it's no longer needed:

---



---



---

Now let's test the build one final time:

---

```bash
dotnet build --verbosity minimal
```

```
C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Schema>dotnet build --verbosity minimal
