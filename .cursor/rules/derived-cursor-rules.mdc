## TECH STACK

*   C#
*   ImGuiApp (ktsu.ImGuiApp package)

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

*   `docs/features/schema-editor.md`
*   `docs/README.md`
*   `docs/getting-started.md`
*   `docs/api/schema-core.md`

## DEBUGGING

*   When encountering build errors, examine the problematic code and relevant method signatures.
*   Search the codebase for method signatures to understand available overloads.
*   Investigate recent changes or documentation for relevant packages to identify correct signatures.
*   Pay close attention to the specific error messages provided by the compiler, as they indicate the file, line number, and type of error.
*   When build errors persist, use a minimal verbosity level during the build process (`dotnet build --verbosity minimal`) to quickly identify the remaining errors.
*   When addressing code analysis warnings (IDE00XX), consult the provided links to understand the specific style rule and apply the suggested fix.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

## CODING STANDARDS

*   Avoid multiple blank lines in code.
*   When referencing static methods, qualify them with the type name instead of using an instance reference.
*   Remove unused private properties to avoid code analysis warnings (IDE0052).
